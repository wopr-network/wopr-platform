/**
 * Observability — health checks, metrics, and structured logging.
 *
 * Will host extracted observability code from core (WOP-297):
 * - health: platform health endpoints
 * - metrics: instance and fleet metrics collection
 * - logging: structured logging configuration
 *
 * Currently, health routes live in api/routes/health.ts
 * and logging lives in config/logger.ts.
