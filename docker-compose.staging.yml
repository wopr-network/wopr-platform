## DEPRECATED — do not use this file.
##
## This file is kept for historical reference only.
## It predates the unified compose-first deployment stack.
##
## Use the unified docker-compose.yml with staging environment variables instead:
##
##   docker compose --env-file .env.staging up -d
##
## Copy .env.staging.example → .env.staging and fill in staging values.
## The same docker-compose.yml is used for both production and staging;
## only the .env file differs. This is the compose-first principle:
##
##   "Same compose file on both — different .env values."
##
## Why this file was stale:
## - Used `build: .` instead of pre-built GHCR images
## - Missing Caddy reverse proxy service
## - Missing platform-ui service
## - Hardcoded staging-only env vars that belong in .env.staging
## - Separate staging network instead of the shared wopr-platform network
